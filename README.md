# themes for renoise

## HOW TO INSTALL

Download the zip file (green "clone or download" button in the top right), extract it, drag and drop the xrnc in renoise. enjoy.

## Milky

An adaptation of the default MilkyTracker theme for Renoise. Oldskool feeling.

Renoise doesn't support different backgrounds for boxes and the pattern so they all had to be black unfortunately.
