Themes for renoise

HOW TO INSTALL: download the zip file (clone or download button), extract it, drag and drop the xrnc in renoise. enjoy.

## Milky

An adaptation of the default MilkyTracker theme for Renoise. Oldskool feeling.

Renoise doesn't support different backgrounds for boxes and the pattern so they all had to be black unfortunately.
